# Plant Buddy, a self-care mobile app
A mobile application built with Java to support mindfulness, emotional wellness, and daily self-care routines.

## Background
The current fast-paced lifestyle in Singapore causes many individuals to struggle with maintaining consistent self-care habits due to lack of time, motivation and access to supportive resources. Traditional mental health support systems require in-person or video call interactions which can be inconvenient and uncomfortable for some. Despite the increase in mental health awareness in current society, there is few interactive and entertaining self-care activities. As a result, many people still lack the motivation and consistency to adopt self-care habits.

Hence, our problem statement is:

**How might we encourage individuals to engage in good self-care habits?**

## Solution
To address this issue, our team decided to create a self-care app called PlantBuddy to promote healthy habits and emotional wellness. The app enables users to track their moods, set personalised self-care goals. A unique feature to PlantBuddy is the growth of a virtual plant companion that grows whenever the user completes their self-care goals.
PlantBuddy offers a discreet and convenient way for users to engage in mental health support anytime and anywhere, eliminating the need for face-to-face interactions. By making mental health care more approachable in a friendly and gamified manner, PlantBuddy seeks to reduce the stigma and encourage a more proactive approach to self-care.
